## Steps Performed
- Handling missing data
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Correltion Plot and Matrix
- Data Preparation
- One Hot Encoding
- Train-Test Split
- Model Building
- Feature Selection


- #### Feature selection made us understand that only 20 features are good and useful enough for our model to give good accuracy so instead of using all 41 columns we can use only 20 columns to achieve our results.


### Negatively Correlated
- Smaller the age more likely it is to churn
- less the deposits and witdrawals more likely it is to churn 
- Similarly with the purchases , cc recommended etc. We can see from the correlation plot above
......

### Correlated 
- The people who have taken Credit Card are more likely to churn means there is issue in our credit card or its features
- Also the web and iOS users are more likely to churn than ANdroid Users means that the iOS and web application have issue and need to be fixed

# CONCLUSION
- #### Our Model has provided us with an indication that which users are likely to churn wit 64% accuracy.
